<!--![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/TuhinBar/optical) -->
Optical is a CLI tool that generates a Go [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) project template. It is inspired by express-generator, a tool that produces a Node.js project template for the Express.js framework.

It is named Optical because it works with Fiber and combines 'fiber-optic'. Silly.

üîµ Although there are big-scale CLI tools exist like [create-go-app](https://github.com/create-go-app/cli) to help you create Full-Stack Apps using Go and JS/TS, optical is just a fiber-dependent CLI tool to generate API/Backend only.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

If you do not have Go installed on your device, you are required to install it to run this tool.


You can install Optical CLI using Go:

```bash
go install github.com/TuhinBar/optical@latest
```

Or you can use our installation script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuhinBar/optical/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## ‚ö°Usage

To create a new Optical project:

```bash
optical -gh <guthub-username> -init -name <your-project-name>
```
or

To get help and see all the flags:
```bash
optical -h
```

After creating the project run this:

Optical generates the starting files for your project. You can configure your project folder and files according to your requirements.

To set up your project further, refer to the [Fiber Official Docs](https://docs.gofiber.io/)

## üî∑ Example

If you run a command like:
```bash
optical -gh TuhinBar -init -name cyber-fiber
```

It will create a new Optical project in a directory named `cyber-fiber` with `go.mod` like this :
```bash
module github.com/TuhinBar/cyber-fiber

go 1.22

require github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2 v2.52.5
